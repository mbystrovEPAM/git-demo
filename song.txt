La-la la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la la-la
La-la la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire

I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough
